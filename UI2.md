UI Design Dictionary: Web & Mobile Applications
Introduction
User Interface (UI) design is the process designers use to build interfaces in software or computerized devices, focusing on looks or style. 1 Designers aim to create interfaces that users find easy to use and pleasurable. 2 UI design typically refers to graphical user interfaces but also includes others, such as voice-controlled ones. 3 This dictionary covers common terms used in designing graphical user interfaces for web and mobile applications.
